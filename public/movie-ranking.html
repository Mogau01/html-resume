<h2>Here are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>All the Bright Places</h3>
<p>I love how it defines humanity through the caring character that has their own problems but also finds a way to make another person feel happier, 
    showing that there's more to life after losing a loved one.</p>

<h3>Fatherhood</h3>
<p>This movies shows that fathers can also take up a more soft approach on parenting, which is the exact oppsite of what we see when we grow up, 
    fathers can aslo care for their children and raise them with lots of love.</p>

<h3>Click</h3>
<p>This movie is a perfect example of the saying life is not sprint race,
    it is a marathon. I love how it teaches you to slow down and take each stage of life with patience,
    skipping most important parts will leave you in distraught wishing you could go back and experience what you've never got the chance to see. Time machines haven't been
    invented yet, so there is no way of turning back time to the moments missed, enjoy life as it comes do not rush.</p>
